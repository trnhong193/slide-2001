Alert message sent to supervisor with video clip capturing the person 15 seconds before encroachment until 10 seconds after leaving the danger zone. Flash light warning signal and siren speaker attached to the crane hook.    | Danger zone can be adjusted and not less than a 7m radius from the crane hook.
